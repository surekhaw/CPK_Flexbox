# California Pizza Kitchen
## Flexbox

At The Last Mile, our Web Development Fundamentals ("WDF") students learn HTML and CSS skills.  One of the required assignments by which they demonstrate their mastery of these skills is by duplicating a California Pizza Kitchen website.  A screenshot of the completed website is available for students to see what their end product should look like.  They are also provided with a folder of images to use.  

This project is an exemplar created for The Last Mile WDF students to review after they submit their assignment that demonstrates recreating the California Pizza Kitchen website using Flexbox.  Because the purpose of the assignment is to practice HTML and CSS skills, there is no javascript.  As the students have not learned media queries at this stage of the curriculum, the exemplar is not designed to be responsive, and was specifically built to be viewed on a 14in display in Google Chrome.  

This project was created for The Last Mile while employed as a Web Development Education Apprentice and is herein included with permission of The Last Mile.  

Below is the screenshot provided to students of the website they must duplicate for the assignment:
